This project allows you to generate different types of color schemes for the development of websites, apps, and more.
To use it, drag a slider for each color value until the background is a color you want in your scheme.
Then use the buttons at the bottom to generate different types of color schemes.
RGB and hex values are provided in order to make creating the colors easy wherever you wish to use them.

Enjoy, and *color on*!
